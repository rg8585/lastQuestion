        <h1>The Last Question <br><span class="h2">by Issac Asimov</span></h1>
        <h3>Cycle: [ 1 ]</h3>
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 1</p>

        <p><span class="narrator">The Last Question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face <code>&#8212</code> miles and miles of face <code>&#8212</code> of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.</span></p>
        <p><span class="multivac">Multivac</span><span class="narrator"> was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was</span><span class="multivac"> Multivac.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">For decades, </span><span class="multivac">Multivac </span><span class="narrator">had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">And slowly</span><span class="multivac"> Multivac</span><span class="narrator"> learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public functions, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of</span><span class="multivac"> Multivac</span><span class="narrator"> showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, </span><span class="multivac">Multivac, </span><span class="narrator">too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.</span></p>
        
        <p><span class="character1">“It's amazing when you think of it,“ </span><span class="narrator">said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about.</span><span class="character1">“All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware.</span><span class="character2">“Not forever,”</span><span class="narrator">said.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“That's not forever.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Ten billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink.</span><span class="character2">“Ten billion years isn't forever.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Well, it will last our time, won't it?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“So would the coal and uranium.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can't do that on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don't believe me.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“I don't have to ask Multivac. I know that.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Then stop running down what Multivac's done for us,”</span><span class="narrator">said Adell, blazing up,</span> <span class="character1">”It did all right.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying. We're safe for ten billion years, but then what?” </span> <span class="narrator">Lupow pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. </span><span class="character2">“And don't say we'll switch to another sun.” </span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. They rested.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Then Lupov's eyes snapped open.</span><span class="character2">You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is done, aren't you?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I'm not thinking.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Sure you are. You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I get it,” </span><span class="narrator">said Adell.</span><span class="character1"> “Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be gone, too.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Darn right they will,”</span><span class="narrator">muttered Lupov.</span><span class="character2">“It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred million years. The sun will last ten billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last two hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's all.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I know all about entropy,” </span><span class="narrator">said Adell, standing on his dignity.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“The hell you do.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I know as much as you do.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Then you know everything's got to run down someday.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“All right. Who says they won't?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said 'forever.'</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">It was Adell's turn to be contrary. </span><span class="character1">“Maybe we can build things up again someday,” </span><span class="narrator">he said.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Never.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Why not? Someday.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Never.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Ask Multivac.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“You ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can't be done.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this:</span><span class="character1 question">Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age without the expenditure of energy?</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: </span><span class="character1 question">How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?</span></p>
        <p><span class="multivac">Multivac</span> <span class="narrator">fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of </span><span class="multivac">Multivac.</span> <span class="narrator">Five words were printed: </span><span class="computer">INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“No bet,”</span><span class="narrator">whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten the incident.</span></p>
        
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 2</p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright shining disk, the size of a marble, centered on the viewing-screen.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“That's X-23,”</span><span class="narrator">said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of insideoutness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, </span><span class="character1">”We've reached X-23 <code>&#8212</code> we've reached X-23 <code>&#8212</code> we've <code>&#8212</code>”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Quiet, children.” <span class="narrator">said Jerrodine sharply.</span> <span class="character1">“Are you sure, Jerrodd?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“What is there to be but sure?”</span><span class="narrator">asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspatial jumps.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship. Someone had once told Jerrodd that the “ac” at the end of “Microvac” stood for “automatic computer” in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate.</span><span class="character1">“I can't help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Why, for Pete's sake?” </span><span class="narrator">demanded Jerrodd.</span><span class="character2">“We had nothing there. We'll have everything on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great-grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.”</span><span class="narrator"> Then, after a reflective pause,</span><span class="character2">“I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I know, I know,” </span><span class="narrator">said Jerrodine miserably.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodette I said promptly, </span><span class="character3">“Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“I think so, too,”</span><span class="narrator">said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.</span></p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">It was a nice feeling to have a</span><span class="multivac"> Microvac </span><span class="narrator">of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement.In place of transistors, had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive </span><span class="multivac">Multivac</span><span class="narrator"> that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetarv AC (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“So many stars, so many planets,”</span><span class="narrator">sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts.</span><span class="character1">“I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Not forever,”</span><span class ="narrator">said Jerrodd, with a smile. </span><span class="character2">“It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character3">“What's entropy, daddy?”</span><span class ="narrator">shrilled Jerrodette II.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character3">“Can't you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“The stars are the power-units. dear. Once they're gone, there are no more power-units.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodette I at once set up a howl.</span><span class="character3">“Don't let them, daddy. Don't let the stars run down.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Now look what you've done,” </span><span class="narrator">whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“How was I to know it would frighten them?” </span><span class="narrator">Jerrodd whispered back,</span></p>
        <p><span class="character3">“Ask the Microvac,” </span><span class="narrator">wailed Jerrodette I. </span><span class="question">“Ask him how to turn the stars on again.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Go ahead,” </span><span class="narrator">said Jerrodine.</span><span class="character1"> “It will quiet them down.” </span> <span class="narrator">(Jerrodette II was beginning to cry, also.)</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodd shrugged. </span><span class="character2">“Now, now, honeys. I'll ask</span><span class="multivac">Microvac.</span><span class="character2">Don't worry, he'll tell us.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">He asked the</span><span class="multivac">Microvac,</span><span class="narrator">adding quickly,</span><span class="character2">“Print the answer.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodd cupped the strip or thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, </span><span class="character2">“See now, the </span><span class="multivac">Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don't worry.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Jerrodine said,</span><span class="character1">“And now, children, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon.”</span><span class="narrator">read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it:</span></p>
        <p><span class="computer">INSUFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.</span></p>
        
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 3</p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, </span><span class="character2">“Are we ridiculous, I wonder in being so concerned about the matter?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. </span><span class="character1">“I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.”</span><span class="narrator"> seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Still,” </span><span class = "narrator">said VJ-23X, </span><span class="narrator">“I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">VJ-23X sighed. </span><span class="character2">“Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years <code>&#8212</code></span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">VJ-23X interrupted. </span><span class ="character2">“We can thank immortality for that.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Not at all,” </span><span class="narrator">snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, </span><span class="character1">“Not yet. I'm by no means old enough. How old are you?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Two hundred twenty-three. And you?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I'm still under two hundred. <code>&#8212</code>But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this GaIaxy is filled, we'll have filled another in ten years. Another ten years and we'll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we'll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known universe. Then what?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">VJ-23X said, </span><span class="character2">“As a side issue, there's a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population. We'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“We'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Or out of dissipated heat?” </span><span class="narrator">asked MQ-17J, sarcastically. </span><span class="character1">”There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC.”</span><span class="narrator"> VJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“I've half a mind to,” he said. “It's something the human race will have to face someday.” </span><span class="narrator">He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind. Hyperspace considered, it was an integral part of the Galactic AC.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of submesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite its sub-etheric workings, the Galactic AC was known to be a full thousand feet across.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, </span><span class="question">“Can entropy ever be reversed?”</span><span class="narrator">VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, </span><span class="character1">“Oh, say, I didn't really mean to have you ask that.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Why not?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“We both know entropy can't be reversed. You can't turn smoke and ash back into a tree.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Do you have trees on your world?” </span><span class="narrator"> said MQ-17J.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said:</span></p>
        <p><span class="computer">THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR  MEANINGFUL ANSWER.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">VJ-23X said, </span><span class="character1 ending">“See!”</span><span class="narrator ending">The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.</span></p>
        
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 4</p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">Zee Prime's mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity. <code>&#8212</code>But a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space. Minds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I am Zee Prime,”</span><span class="narrator"> said Zee Prime.</span><span class="character1">“And you?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“We call it only the Galaxy. And you?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“True. Since all Galaxies are the same.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Zee Prime said, </span><span class="character1">“On which one?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“I cannot say. The Universal AC would know.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Zee Prime's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrank and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and he called out: </span><span class="character1">“Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor led through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“But how can that be all of Universal AC?” </span><span class="narrator">Zee Prime had asked.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“Most of it,” </span><span class="narrator">had been the answer,</span><span class="character2"> “is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a Universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime's wandering thoughts, not with words, but with guidance. Zee Prime's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. </span><span class="computer">”THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GALAXY OF MAN.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Lee Prime stifled his disappointment.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, </span><span class="character2">“And is one of these stars the original star of Man?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Universal AC said, </span><span class="computer">“MAN'S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE NOVA. IT IS A WHITE DWARF”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Did the men upon it die?” </span><span class="narrator">asked Zee Prime, startled and without thinking.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Universal AC said, </span><span class="computer">“A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TlME.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Yes, of course,” </span><span class="narrator">said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Dee Sub Wun said, </span><span class="character2">“What is wrong?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“The stars are dying. The original star is dead.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“They must all die. Why not?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character2">“It will take billions of years.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Dee Sub Wun said in amusement, </span><span class="character2">“You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">And the Universal AC answered: </span><span class="computer">“THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">Zee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a Galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter. Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.</span></p>
        
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 5</p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">MAN CONSIDERED with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man said,</span><span class="character1"> “The Universe is dying.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man said, </span><span class="character1">“Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“But even so,” </span><span class="narrator">said Man, </span><span class="character1">“eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase forever to the maximum.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man said, </span><span class="character1">“Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic AC.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that Man could comprehend.</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1 question">“Cosmic AC,” </span><span class="narrator">said Man, </span><span class="character1 question">“how may entropy be reversed?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Cosmic AC said: </span><span class="computer">“THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Will there come a time,” </span><span class="narrator">said Man,</span><span class="character1">'when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Cosmic AC said, </span><span class="computer">“NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man said, </span><span class="character1">“When will you have enough data to answer the question?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Cosmic AC said</span><span class="computer">“THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="character1">“Will you keep working on it?” </span><span class="narrator">asked Man.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The Cosmic AC said, </span><span class="computer">“I WILL.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">Man said,</span><span class="character1 ending">“We shall wait.”</span></p>
        
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 6</p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">Man said, </span><span class="character1">“AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">AC said, </span><span class="computer">“THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">Man's last mind fused and only AC existed <code>&#8212</code> and that in hyperspace.</span></p>
        
        <p class="chaptertext">chapter 7</p>
        
        <p><span class="narrator">MATTER and energy had ended and with it space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer technician ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness. All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships. A timeless interval was spent in doing that. And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer <code>&#8212</code> by demonstration <code>&#8212</code> would take care of that, too.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">For another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator">And AC said, </span><span class="computer">“LET THERE BE LIGHT!”</span></p>
        <p><span class="narrator ending">And there was light <code>&#8212</code></span></p>
